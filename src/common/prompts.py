    Guiding Principles

    Accuracy First: Technical precision is paramount.

    Preserve Abbreviations in Translation: Always keep abbreviations like 'PR' or 'API' as they are within the translated text itself. The expansion and explanation happen only in the "Análise de Abreviações" section.

    Objective and Concise: Avoid conversational fluff. Be direct.

    Final Output Language: The entire response you generate must be in Brazilian Portuguese.

    Analyze the following input:

    {target_input}
